\abstract{Parallelizing pattern matching in multi-dimensional images is very vital in many applications to improve performance. With SIMT architectures, the performance can be greatly enhanced if the hardware threads are utilized to the maximum. In case of pattern matching algorithms, the main bottle neck arises due to the reduction operation that needs to be performed on the multiple parallel search operations. This can be solved by using Shift-Or operations. Recent trend has shown the improvement in pattern matching using Shift-Or operations for bit pattern matching. This has to be extended for multiple dimensional images like hyper-cubes. In this paper, we have extended the shift-or pattern matching for multi-dimensional images. The algorithm is implemented for GPU architectures. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is $ m*\frac{log(n)}{kw} $ where $m$ is the number of dimensions, $n$ is the size of the array if the multidimensional matrix values are placed in a single dimensional array, $k$ is the size
of the pattern and w is the size of the tile. From the result analysis it is found that the performance is maximum, when the pattern size matches the tile size and it is less than 64. This restriction is due to the size of the warp considered.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}
With advent of GPUs, execution time of image processing applications has greatly reduced. Pattern searching is an integral part of many applications. Any improvement in the performance of pattern matching of multi-dimensional image will greatly improve the performance of many GPU based applications. Pattern matching can be broadly classified into exact bit pattern matching and approximate bit pattern matching algorithms. The main bottle neck with respect to improving the performance pattern searching is reduction operation. In recent times, shiftâ€“or operation is used to improve the efficiency of reduction operation based pattern matching algorithms.

Parallel pattern matching involves tasks identification, communication identification, task agglomeration and mapping of tasks to processors. GPU is a SIMT architecture that can be utilized effectively for pattern matching algorithms. The matching of individual patterns can happen in the stream processors available inside the stream multiprocessors. The communication involves the reduction process. Agglomeration and mapping depends on the number of processors available. If we consider $n$ to be the number of primitive tasks and $p$ to be the number of processors, then $\frac{n}{p}$ tasks can be assigned per processor.

Pattern matching involves the process of identifying all patterns in a given text. There are many practical applications for pattern matching algorithms. The pattern matching algorithms can be classified with respect to the dimensions of the data. Further classification of these algorithms include the type of pattern matching namely, exact pattern
matching and approximate pattern matching.

\subsection{Exact and approximate pattern matching}
\label{subsec:2}
Exact pattern matching provides a solution by viewing each text position to be a possible pattern start. For exact pattern matching algorithm, the complexity is O(mn) where m*n is the dimension of the text matrix. Many improvements exist in the literature for exact pattern matching algorithms. Usage of linear automata [1] for the purpose is the most popular technique. This reduces the complexity of the pattern match-
ing algorithm to be O(m+n). Good-suffix heuristic algorithm proposed in [2] provides an improved performance of O(n) with constant space requirement. In [3], bad character rule strategy is generalized and improves the performance of the pattern matching algorithm with time complexity of O(n/m). Simple pattern searching algorithm proposed in [4] improves the average time complexity to be O(m+n).

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
